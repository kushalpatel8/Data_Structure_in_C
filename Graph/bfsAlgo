Algorithm Explanation:
Initialization:

A queue (q) is created to help with the BFS traversal.
The visited array for the graph is updated to mark the starting vertex (start) as visited.
The starting vertex is enqueued into the queue.
BFS Traversal:

While the queue is not empty:
The front vertex (currentVertex) is dequeued and processed (e.g., printed).
The algorithm checks all the vertices adjacent to currentVertex using the adjacency matrix (G->adjMat).
If an adjacent vertex is found (G->adjMat[currentVertex][i] == 1) and it has not been visited (G->visited[i] == 0), it is marked as visited and enqueued for processing.
Termination:

The BFS traversal ends when the queue becomes empty, meaning all reachable vertices have been visited.
Key Points:
Data Structures:
A queue is used to ensure that vertices are processed in the correct BFS order (FIFO).
The visited array is used to prevent revisiting nodes and forming loops.
Graph Representation:
The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where G->adjMat[i][j] == 1 means there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j.
Output:
The algorithm prints the vertices in BFS traversal order starting from the given start vertex.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑉2) 
Checking adjacency in an adjacency matrix takes 𝑂(𝑉)
O(V) for each vertex, and there are 𝑉
V vertices.
Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑉)
Space is required for the queue and the visited array.
